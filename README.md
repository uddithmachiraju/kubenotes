# Project Overview
In this project I am going to build a notes api completely outoff docker, kubernetes and Flask. Don't ask me about the functionality of this project like how can we add notes or anything like that cause I am not focused on how things works but more focused on how tools help things work.

## Tools and Technologies used
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Flask 
- Streamlit 
- logging 
- pytest
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB

## Features of the project
Will be written when I start to write down things

## How to run this file
1. Open the project in vscode and you gonna see a pop up saying `Rebuild Container`. Click on that and wait to open the workspace in a dockerized environemt(Make sure the Docker is running in the background). 
2. Go to `backend` and run `poetry run python main.py`
3. Open a new terminal.
4. Go to `frontend/app` and run `poetry run streamlit run main.py` 
5. Boom! Go to the endpoint and play with the application.
